    All allies within 15ft are rendered invisible.

    Modified On: June 20, 2004
        - If the target already has the effect, then do not give them another.
            This is to prevent incorrect loss of effects.
            An example: Mage A and Mage B, both have this AoE on them.
                Mage B enters Mage A's AoE, so normally it would give him Mage A's
                AoE effects, even if Mage B already had said effects.
                This is fine, but when Mage B leaves Mage A's AoE, the effects
                will be dispelled and will be kept off untill their AoE refreshes...
                when clearly Mage B has his own AoE of the same type.
