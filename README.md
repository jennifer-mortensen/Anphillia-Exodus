I lead the development of the Anphillia Exodus module for the original v1.69 version of Neverwinter Nights. It was a fork of TheMothMan's Anphillia Genesis, which itself was an evolution of the original Anphillia. Anphillia was a popular two-faction RP-PvP module intended to be hosted online. Essentially, it was a small-scale MMO that encouraged teams of players to work together to claim victory on the battlefield.

Initially, I considered this module proprietary, but given that Anphillia Exodus has not been officially hosted in years, I've uploaded it as a neat little relic and a tribute to a team I really enjoyed working with. Feel free to do with it as you will.

Note that this module uses the CEP2 expansion pack (link here: https://neverwintervault.org/cep). It also uses .dlls from the original Windows distribution of NwNX. I have not included those here since they are not compatible with the Enhanced Edition of Neverwinter Nights; I would instead recommend porting the project to the newer Linux branch (information here: https://nwnxee.github.io/unified/).

Beyond that, all you need to get the module running is the module (included in the modules folder) and the .2das intended for the override folder. I have included the source folder only to expose the source code for viewership online.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Mortensen (aka J. Persinne / Peppermint)
